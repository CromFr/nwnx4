# Build

## Using a Visual Studio 2019

- Install [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#visual-studio-community-2019)
- Open `src/NWNX4.sln` with Visual Studio
- Press F6 or go to _Build -> Build solution_


# Work in progress

[ ] nwnx_gui should be ported to use latest Qt version
[ ] xp_ruby: I could not find any up-to-date prebuilt Ruby C library to link against
[ ] xp_chat does not work (error triggered when a player enters the server). This plugin is probably useless since you can set a custom OnChat script in the module properties.
