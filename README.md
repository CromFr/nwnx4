## Using a Visual Studio 2005

- Setup yourself a virtual machine with Windows XP (it may work with more recent OSes though)
- Install Visual Studio 2005 (I couldn't find legit versions on Microsoft websites, I downloaded a torrent)
- Open src/nwnx4.sln with Visual Studio 2005
- Press F7 or go to _Build -> Build solution_
